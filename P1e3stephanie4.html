  <h1 class="darkest">Popularity is <u>not</u> wrong </h1>
  <h2 class="darker">in and of itself, but it has its own perils.</h2>
  <h3 class="dark">In a free-market economy, low-quality goods with the wrong prices are doomed to failure.</h3>
  <h4 class="light">Nobody gets upset when a quiet Brooklyn cafe with bad lattes and rude servers goes out of business.</h4>
  <h5 class="lighter">But opinions are <u>not</u> the same as material goods or services.They won’t disappear if they are unpopular or even <em>bad.</em></h5>
  <h6 class="lightest">In fact, history has proven that most big ideas (and many bad ones) have been quite unpopular for a long time, <br>
  and their marginal status has only strengthened them.<br>
<br>
  Minority views are radicalized when they can’t be expressed and recognized.<br>
<br>
  Today the Stream is digital media’s <strong>dominant</strong> form of organizing information.<br>
  It’s in every social network and mobile application. Since I gained my freedom, everywhere I turn I see the Stream.<br>
  I guess it won’t be too long before we see news websites organize their entire content based on the same principles.<br>
  The <strong>prominence </strong>of the Stream today doesn’t just make vast chunks of the Internet biased against quality — <br>
  it also means a <sub>deep </sub>betrayal to the diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned.</h6>
<br>
  <h1 class="darkest">There’s no question to me </h1>
  <h2 class="darker">that the diversity of themes and opinions </h2>
  <h3 class="dark">is less online today than it was in the past.</h3>
  <h4 class="light">New, different, and challenging ideas get suppressed by today’s social networks </h4>
  <h5 class="lighter">because their ranking strategies prioritize the popular and habitual. (No wonder why Apple is hiring human editors for its news app.) <br>
  But diversity is being reduced in other ways, and for other purposes.</h5>
<br>
  <h6 class="lightest"><strong>Some of it is visual.</strong><br>
<br>
  Yes, it is true that all my posts on Twitter and Facebook look something similar to a personal blog:<br>
    They are collected in reverse-chronological order, on a specific webpage, with direct web addresses to each post.<br>
    But I have <em>very little</em> control over how it looks like; I can’t personalize it much. <br>
    My page must follow a uniform look which the designers of the social network decide for me.<br></h6>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">with bad lattes and rude <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">servers goes out of business. <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">opinions are not the same <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">as material goods or services. <br></span>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">In fact, history has proven  <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">that most big ideas (and <br></span>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">be expressed and recognized. <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">Today the Stream is digital media’s  <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">dominant form of organizing <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">information. It’s in every social <br></span>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">&nbsp;be too long before we see news websites <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">organize their entire content based on  <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">the same principles. The prominence <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">of the Stream today doesn’t just make <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="ingredient">vast chunks of the Internet biased <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">against quality — it also means a <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="ingredient">deep betrayal to the diversity that <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">the world wide web had originally <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">envisioned. There’s no question to <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">me that the diversity of themes and <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">opinions is less online today than it <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">was in the past. New, different, and <br></span>
&nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">challenging ideas get suppressed by <br></span>
<span class="ingredient">today’s social networks because their <br></span>
&nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">ranking strategies prioritize the popular <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">and habitual. (No wonder why Apple is <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">hiring human editors for its news app.) <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">But diversity is being reduced in other <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">ways, and for other purposes. Some of <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">it is visual. Yes, it is true that all my posts <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">on Twitter and Facebook look something <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">similar to a personal blog: They are collected <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">in reverse-chronological order, on a specific <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">webpage, with direct web addresses to each post. <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">But I have very little control over how it looks like; <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">I can’t personalize it much. My page must follow a uniform <br></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ingredient">look which the designers of the social network decide for me.<br></span></p>

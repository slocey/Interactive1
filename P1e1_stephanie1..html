  Popularity is &nbsp; not &nbsp; wrong in and of itself, <br><br>

  and their marginal status has only strengthened them. <br><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; views are radicalized when they can’t be expressed and recognized.<br>

  Today the Stream is digital media’s &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; form of organizing information.<br><br>
  It’s in every social network and mobile application.<br><br>
  Since I gained my &nbsp; &nbsp; f &nbsp; r &nbsp; e &nbsp; e &nbsp; d &nbsp; o &nbsp; m, &nbsp; &nbsp; everywhere I turn I see the Stream.<br><br>
  I guess it won’t be too long before we see news websites organize their entire content based on the same principles.<br><br><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; prominence <br>
  The &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the Stream today doesn’t just make vast &nbsp; c h u n k s &nbsp; of the Internet biased against quality <br> <br><br>

  New, different, and challenging ideas get &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by today’s social networks because their ranking strategies &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the popular and habitual. <br>

  (No wonder why Apple is hiring human editors for its news app.) <br><br>
  But diversity is being &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in other ways, and for other purposes.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reduced <br><br>
Some of it is visual. <br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, it is true that all my posts on Twitter and Facebook <br>
look something similar to a personal blog: They are collected <br>
in reverse-chronological order, on a specific webpage, with <br>
direct web addresses to each post. <br> <br>
But I have very &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; control over how it looks like; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; little <br><br>
I can’t personalize it much.<br> <br>

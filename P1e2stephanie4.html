<h2> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stream</h1>

<p>Popularity is <u>not</u> wrong in and of itself, <em>but</em> it has its own perils.<br>
   In a free-market economy, <sub>low-quality</sub> goods with the wrong prices <br>
   are doomed to failure. <em>Nobody</em> gets upset when a quiet Brooklyn <br>
   cafe with <em>bad</em> lattes and <em>rude </em>servers goes out of business.<br></p>

<p>But opinions are <u>not</u> the same as material goods or services. They <br>
  won’t disappear if they are unpopular or even <em>bad</em>. In fact, history <br>
  has proven that most big ideas (and many bad ones) have been <em>quite</em> <br>
  unpopular for a long time, and their marginal status has only <br>
  strengthened them. Minority views are radicalized when they can’t <br>
  be expressed and recognized.<br></p>

<p>Today <strong>the Stream </strong>is digital media’s dominant form of organizing <br>
  information. It’s in <em>every</em> social network and mobile application. <br>
  Since I gained my freedom, everywhere I turn I see <strong>the Stream.</strong> <br>
  I guess it won’t be too long before we see news websites organize <br>
  their entire content based on the same principles. The prominence <br>
  of <strong>the Stream </strong>today doesn’t <em>just</em> make vast chunks of the Internet <br>
  biased against quality — it <u>also</u> means a deep betrayal to the <br>
  diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned.<br></p>

<p>There’s no question to me that the diversity of themes and opinions <br>
  is <sub>less</sub> online today than it was in the past. <em>New, different, and <br>
  challenging ideas</em> get <sub>suppressed </sub>by today’s social networks <br>
  because their ranking strategies <sup>prioritize</sup> the popular and habitual. <br>
  <em>(No wonder why Apple is hiring human editors for its news app.)</em> <br>
  <u>But</u> diversity is being reduced in other ways, and for other purposes. <br>
  <em>Some of it is visual.</em></p>

<p><u>Yes</u>, it is true that all my posts on Twitter and Facebook look <br>
  something similar to a personal blog: They are collected in <br>
  reverse-chronological order, on a specific webpage, with direct web <br>
  addresses to each post. <u>But</u> I have very little control over how it <br>
  looks like; I can’t personalize it much. My page <em>must </em>follow a <br>
  uniform look which the designers of the social network decide for <br>
  me.<br></p>

  Popularity is not <br>
wrong in and of itself,<br>
but it has its own perils. In a <br>
free-market economy, low-quality goods <br>
with the wrong prices are doomed to failure. <br>
<br>
Nobody <br>
<br>
gets upset when a quiet Brooklyn cafe with bad lattes and rude servers goes <br>
out of business. But opinions are not the same as material goods or services.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They won’t disappear if they are unpopular or even bad. <br>
In fact, history has proven that most big ideas<br>
(and many bad ones) <br>
have been quite unpopular for a long time,<br>
and their marginal status has only strengthened them. <br>

Today the Stream is digital media’s dominant form of organizing information. It’s in every social network and mobile application. Since I gained my freedom, everywhere I turn I see the Stream. I guess it won’t be too long before we see news websites organize their entire content based on the same principles. The prominence of the Stream today doesn’t just make vast chunks of the Internet biased against quality — it also means a deep betrayal to the diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned.<br>
<br>
There’s no question to me that the diversity of themes and opinions is less online today than it was in the past. <br>
N&nbsp;ew&nbsp;,&nbsp;di&nbsp;ff&nbsp;er&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;nt,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an&nbsp;d&nbsp;ch&nbsp;a&nbsp;lle&nbsp;ngi&nbsp;ng&nbsp;i&nbsp;de&nbsp;as <br>

<br>
because their ranking strategies prioritize the popular and habitual. (No wonder <br>
why Apple is hiring human editors for its news app.) But diversity is being <br>
reduced in other ways, and for other purposes.Some of it is visual. <br>
Yes,it is true that all my posts on Twitter and Facebook look <br>
something similar to a personal blog: They are collected <br>
in reverse-chronological order, on a specific webpage, <br>
with direct web addresses to each post. But I have <br>
very little control over how it looks like; I can’t <br>
personalize it much. My page must follow a <br>
uniform look which the designers of the <br>
social network decide for me.<br>

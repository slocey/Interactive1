Popularity is not wrong in and of itself, but it has its own perils. In a <br>
free-market economy, low-quality goods with the wrong prices are <br>
doomed to failure. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nobody
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
gets upset when a quiet Brooklyn cafe with bad lattes and<br>
rude servers goes out of business. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUT<br>
<br>
opinions are not the same as material goods or services.<br>
<br>
They won’t disappear if they are unpopular or even bad. <br>
<br>
In fact, history has proven that most big ideas (and many bad ones) have <br>
been quite unpopular for a long time, and their marginal status has only <br>
strengthened them. Minority views are radicalized when they can’t be <br>
expressed and recognized.<br>
<br>
Today the Stream is digital media’s dominant form of organizing information. <br>
<br>
It’s in every social network and mobile application. <br>
<br>
Since I gained my freedom, everywhere I turn I see the Stream. <br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
I guess it won’t be too long before we see news websites organize their entire <br>
content based on the same principles. The prominence of the Stream today <br>
doesn’t just make vast chunks of the Internet biased against quality — it also <br>
means a deep betrayal to the diversity that the world wide web had originally <br>
envisioned.<br>
<br>
There’s no question to me that the diversity of themes and opinions is less <br>
online today than it was in the past. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIFFERENT<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and CHALLENGING ideas <br>
<br>
get suppressed by today’s social networks because their ranking strategies <br>
prioritize the popular and habitual. (No wonder why Apple is hiring human <br>
editors for its news app.) But diversity is being reduced in other ways, and for <br>
other purposes.Some of it is visual. Yes, it is true that all my posts on Twitter <br>
and Facebook look something similar to a personal blog: They are collected <br>
in reverse-chronological order, on a specific webpage, with direct web <br>
addresses to each post. But I have very little control over how it looks like; I can’t  <br>
personalize it much. My page must follow a uniform look which the designers <br>
of the social network decide for me. <br>
